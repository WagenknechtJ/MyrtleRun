# MyrtleRun
A parody of the game Frogger in python, using some pygame, where Myrtle from The Great Gatsby tries to cross from the lower-class Valley of Ashes to the high-class New York, however, the wealthy attempt to keep her in her caste by running her over or dragging her away on their expensive boats, because its the 1920's in America. 

Credits to Github user ashivers (https://github.com/ashivers) whose frogger game I used as a template for this game, especially since I had no knowledge of Pygame formerly. And credits to the creators of the images I used of course.
